# Cobra Knot Camera Strap

The Cobra knot generally requires about 1' of paracord for every 1'' of lenthg that you want out of it.

I created a paracord strap to be hung cross shoulder and hang near my hip.  

For me that's about 51'', so I used about 51' of paracord to create this lanyard. 

I used David Blaber's [instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fig0eeAnkUs) on how to make a cobra knot for a braclet.

I modified that design to just leave the loop on the end to attach a [key chain split ring](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H4GC7HH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
